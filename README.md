# Weather-Application

Prior to Opening, please get an API Key from https://openweathermap.org/! Application will ask for an API Key upon first opening, which will then be stored in Local Memory to prevent API Key theft.

- For this week assignment, you will be building a Weather application. 
This app should fetch data from a third party service to tell us the current weather depending on the users location.
- Style your page and make it look attractive.

For this assignment you will be using:
- HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and API

Algorithm problems (See console log for solutions)
1. Given an array of [98,45,78,9,0], use a loop to print this array in reverse.
2. Given an array of [98,45,78,9,0], call a function that accepts the array, goes through it and modifies each element by adding 10, and returns the modified array.
